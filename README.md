# STAT 4188 Final Project: Stock Portfolio Optimization

## Objective:

The objective of my final project is to optimize an investment portfolio. My goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk by optimizing a portfolio of assets.

Throughout this project, I will build an optimized investment portfolio by analyzing historical asset performance as well as recent market trends and applying Modern Portfolio Theory.

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a framework for constructing an investment portfolio that maximizes returns for a given level of risk and minimizes risk for a given level of expected return. It was introduced by economist Harry Markowitz in 1952 in his paper "Portfolio Selection" and later earned him a Nobel Prize in Economics.
